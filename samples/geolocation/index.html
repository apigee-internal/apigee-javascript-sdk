<!-- APIGEE JavaScript SDK ENTITY EXAMPLE APP

This sample app will show you how to perform basic entity operation using the Apigee JavaScript SDK, including:
	
	- Create an entity with location data
	- Query the Apigee API for entities based on location

** IMPORTANT - BEFORE YOU BEGIN **

Be sure to include the Apigee JavaScript SDK (apigee.js) in your code like on line 19 below.

All done? Great, let's get started! -->
