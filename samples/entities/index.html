<!-- APIGEE JavaScript SDK ENTITY EXAMPLE APP

This sample app will show you how to perform basic entity operation using the Apigee JavaScript SDK, including:
	
	- creating an entity
	- retrieving an entity
	- updating/altering an entity
	- deleting an entity


** IMPORTANT - BEFORE YOU BEGIN **

Be sure to include the Apigee JavaScript SDK (apigee.js) in your code like on line 22 below.

All done? Great, let's get started! -->
